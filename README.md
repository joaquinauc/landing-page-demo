<h1>Landing Page Demo</h1>
<p>
    This project is a dummy landing page that uses flex to layout all the html elements. I've applied all the things I've learned since the start of this course.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
    With this project I solidified my foundation with CSS, HTML, and Flexbox. There's still things that I need to polish in the way I structure my divs, and my CSS code, but here I had the opportunity to make something that looks good. With this, I think I achieved an elementary level of mastery over these skills.
